# OOP C# (C Sharp) projects for beginners
This is a set of OOP Sharp projects for beginners which emerged while I thought OOP in 11th grade at high school.

The approach is somehow different than the most courses, tutorials and educations that I stumpled upon. Most of them have boring topics whit no real life correspndence.

I prefer making REAL objects which students can relate to like cats, dogs, cars, traffic light...

I don't start with the basic variable types and do not go in detail of the eight different integer data types.
